# HR2PC Server
This is the source for the server software. This software is a required bridge between the watch and the computer.  
The server software is written in Python, but you do not need it to run the software.  
You'll find a bundled version in the Releases tab.  
However, if you want to run it, you have to first run `pip -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies, and you can run `python main.py` as normal.
