# HR2PC
This program allows you to transfer the heart rate from a Galaxy Watch to your PC in real time.  
This app is still a work in progress.  
The original version I wrote (which is private) was a mess, which is why I decided to rewrite a lot of the code.  
This version is complete with all the neccessary features.  
There won't be an installation guide to this yet since you need to use the SDK to sign the binary file or build the binary from scratch.
