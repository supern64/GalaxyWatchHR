# GalaxyWatchHR
This program allows you to transfer the heart rate from a Galaxy Watch to your PC in real time.  
This app is still a work in progress.  
The original version I wrote (which is private) was a mess, which is why I decided to rewrite a lot of the code.  
It isn't finished yet, but it eventually will.
